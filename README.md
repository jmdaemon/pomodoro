# Pomodoro

Pomodoro is a pomodoro timer program designed to help you manage your time, and study better.
There are 4 time intervals, each with a default of 25 minutes.
After each interval is a 10 minute break.

After four time intervals follows a longer 30 minute break.
After every break, the program is paused and the user can resume the timer manually after the break.
